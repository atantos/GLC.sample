# GLC.sample
<div align="justify">
The <code>GLC.sample</code> package is a data package and consists of 6 vectors with metadata of a sample of 100 students whose productions have been recorded in the Greek Learner Corpus (GLC). The data in this package can serve as a testing suite for hypotheses related to the performance of L2-Greek learners as well as a training basis for teachers who would like to demonstrate some first notions of exploring a dataset quantitatively. </div>  

## GLC and the data
<div align="justify">
These data have been collected during the compilation of the Greek Learner Corpus (or GLC). You can download and browse through the Greek Learner Corpus from clarin:el's portal. I have also added a link below, in the video description. A couple of words about clarin:el and citing from Clarin:el's page, "The clarin:el infrastructure is the Greek part of the European CLARIN infrastructure (www.clarin.eu), a pan-European network of organisations for the collection, documentation, curation and distribution of Language Resources, Technologies and Language processing web services." Clarin is a european effort for bringing data resources from all types of European institutions, including universities such as the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, under a common roof and provides access to datasets, their documentation and to their terms of use. </div>
